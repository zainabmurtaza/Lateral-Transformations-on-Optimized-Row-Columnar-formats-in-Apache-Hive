# Lateral-Transformations-on-Optimized-Row-Columnar-formats-in-Apache-Hive
Used Hive to analyze derived data from the geolocation and trucks tables. The business objective is to better understand the risk the company is under from fatigue of drivers, over-used trucks, and the impact of various trucking events on risk. In order to accomplish this, we will apply a series of lateral transformations to the source data, mostly though SQL but stored in optimized row columnar formats to work well with Hive.
